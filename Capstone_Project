Introduction:
This project aims to help people who would like to open a restaurant in Toronto. To make the final decision, it will be valued from three different perspectives. The first one is the population density in neighborhoods. A restaurant in the neighborhood with more people can create more cash flow. Also, other facilities such as shopping malls, supermarkets, and parking lots are more likely to cluster in those areas. Therefore, residence in Toronto will also cluster in those area, which can bring more benefits to the restaurant. Second, the decision will consider the ethic in Toronto. Canada is well known for its open immigration policy. Hence, residence in Toronto have different ethic and preference of food. This project will also value the proportion and the increase of the ethic to make the decision. 

Data:
The data used in this project is the neighborhoods profile, which contains the population of each neighborhoods, the range of the age, the ethic, income, etc, found from the official website of Toronto.
